### Hi, I'm David!

{{< /imgproc >}}

I am a Computer Engineer from Granada, Spain, specialized in Software
Engineering. In 2018, I obtained my Bachelor's degree at the [University
of Granada](http://www.ugr.es), but I have also studied for one year at
[Lappeenranta University of Technology](http://www.lut.fi), in Finland.
I am mainly interested in the field of Human Computer Interaction and in
the Internet of Things (IoT).

I remember being passionate for technology since I was a little child,
exploring every aspect of the old computer my family had. At the age of
12, I started creating websites and blogs, where I usually wrote about
everything new I learned about technology. Some of them are still online,
being [Apuntux](http://apuntuxold.blogspot.com) one of the most popular.
Years after, I wrote some more posts in a
[newer version](http://apuntux.blogspot.com) of this previous blog.

My first contact with Linux was at the age of 10, and a year later I
started installing different Linux *distros* on the old family computer.
Yes, I broke it once trying to install Gentoo without any manual...

Remember Linux Counter? This was my number

All this could only have one possible end: to study Computer Engineering, so I applied for the univeristy of my hometown, which in fact is among the
[32 best in the world](https://www.elconfidencial.com/tecnologia/ciencia/2017-08-18/granada-ingenieria-informatica_1430045/). 
I created my [GitHub account](https://github.com/dvcarrillo) shortly
after I entered college and I started uploading my projects as soon as I
could. In the university, as well as by myself, I have worked with a wide
range of programming languages and technologies, including C, C++, Java,
Python and Ruby.

Apart from technology, I also love [photography](https://www.flickr.com/photos/davidvargas996/), 
the arts and, above all, travelling and discovering new cultures. This is
why I studied one year abroad in Lappeenranta, Finland. Later on, I did a
volunteering experience in Hungary, thanks to the Erasmus program as
well. Nowadays, I can't wait to live new adventures all around the world!
